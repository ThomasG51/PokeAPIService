## Network Requests

Each model above is an API resource that can fetch data directly from itself using the following functions

##### Fetch one object by ID or name
```swift
// Fetch by id

let pokemonID = 1
Pokemon.selectOne(by: pokemonID)

let generationID = 1
Generation.selectOne(by: generationID)

let pokedexID = 1
Pokedex.selectOne(by: pokedexID)

let gameVersionID = 1
GameVersion.selectOne(by: gameVersionID)


// Fetch by name

let pokemonName = "bulbasaur"
Pokemon.selectOne(by: pokemonName)

let generationName = "generation-i"
Generation.selectOne(by: generationName)

let pokedexName = "kanto"
Pokedex.selectOne(by: pokedexName)

let gameVersionName = "red"
GameVersion.selectOne(by: gameVersionName)
```

##### Fetch a list of objects
```swift
Pokemon.selectAll(from: 151, count: 100)

Generation.selectAll() // Without count argument, the list will be paginate by 20 by default

Pokedex.selectAll(count: 3)

GameVersion.selectAll(from: 0, count: 1)
```

##### Fetch a list of base resources (only id, name and type)
```swift
Pokemon.baseResources(from: 0, count: 151)

Generation.baseResources(from: 0, count: 1)

Pokedex.baseResources(from: 1, count: 1)

GameVersion.baseResources(from: 0, count: 4)
```
