## Resources by category

##### Pokemon
```swift
Pokemon
```
##### Games
```swift
Generation
```

## Network Requests

Each model above is an API resource that can fetch data directly from itself using the following functions

##### Fetch one object resource
```swift
let id: Int = 1
Pokemon.selectOne(by: id)

let name = "bulbasaur"
Pokemon.selectOne(by: name)
```

##### Fetch a list of object resources
```swift
Pokemon.selectAll()

Pokemon.selectAll(count: 151)

Pokemon.selectAll(from: 151, count: 100)
```

##### Fetch a list of base resources (only id, name, type)
```swift
Pokemon.baseResources(from: 0, count: 151)
```

> _‚ö†Ô∏è Some models can't use `SelectAll()` and `baseResources()` functions because the API doesn't allow it. As a result, these two methods are not available for these models._
